## Project Description
Data Sources: 
Sentinel-1 derived oil slick locations
Marine Wildlife Habitat maps

What problems does this issue cause society?:
Oil spills and leaks in the North Sea present significant challenges for society, as they can cause severe environmental degradation, harm marine ecosystems, and disrupt biodiversity. These spills negatively impact the fishing, tourism, and public health sectors, and can lead to social conflicts and policy problems. The financial burden of cleanup efforts, damage to the ecosystem, and contribution to climate change exacerbate the issue, highlighting the need for sustainable management, monitoring and stricter regulations to protect the marine environment and ensure the well-being of coastal communities.

So what? Why should the class care about this issue or question you are addressing?:
You should care about this issue as it demonstrates the intricate balance between economic growth, environmental conservation, and societal well-being. Addressing the consequences of oil spills in the North Sea underlines the need for sustainable resource management, monitoring and awareness of the long-term effects of industrial activities on ecosystems. 

Benefits - How will your research inform this problem / help society?:
The research on oil spills in the North Sea will enhance our understanding of their ecological impact, guiding policymakers and industry practices towards more sustainable management, monitoring and conservation efforts. By raising public awareness and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, the findings will contribute to the protection of marine ecosystems, benefiting both human and marine life in the long run.

Question:
An exploratory analysis of the extend, quantity and effects oil slicks and oil leaks from platforms in the North Sea have on the marine ecosystem.

How can your research inform SOLUTIONS to the Problem?:
The research on oil spills in the North Sea can inform solutions by identifying key locations and sources of spills and identify the effects and areas most affected by oil spills. These findings can lead to enhancing monitoring and early detection systems. Additionally, the findings can facilitate stakeholder collaboration to develop integrated and adaptive solutions to address the complex challenges of preserving marine ecosystems.
